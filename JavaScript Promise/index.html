        // What is promise in javascript
        // A promise is a result object that is used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It is used to handle the result of an asynchronous operation, whether it is successful or failed.
        // A promise is a proxy for a value that may not be available yet, because we ar waiting for something else to happen before we can get that value.
        // A promise is in one of these states: pending, fulfilled or rejected.
        // A promise can be created in three ways: new Promise(), Promise.resolve(), Promise.reject()
        // A promise can be chained with then() and catch() methods to handle the result of an asynchronous operation.
        // A promise can be cancelled with the abort() method.
        // A promise can be cancelled with the cancel() method.
        let p = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            setTimeout(()=>{
              let a = 1 + 2;
            if (a == 3) {
                resolve("Promise resolved");
            }
            else {
                reject("Promise rejected");
            }  
            },1000)
            
        })
        // console.log(p)
        p.then((msg)=>{
            document.write(msg)
        }).catch((msg)=>{
            document.write(msg)
