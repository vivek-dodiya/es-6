        // What is Class And Objects
        // Classes are blueprints or templates for creating objects.
        // Objects are instances of classes, and they have properties and methods.
        // Classes are used to define the properties and methods of an object, while objects are used to create instances of a class.
        // Classes are like a blueprint for creating objects, while objects are the actual instances of that blueprint
        class Student {
            name ; // we van create number of properties
            welcome(){ // this is prototype method
                document.write("welcome to the class <br>")
            }
        };
        // Creating an object from a class
        let vivek = new Student();
        vivek.welcome(); // Accessing the properties and methods of an object
        vivek.name = "vivek"
        document.write(vivek.name);
        document.write("<br>")

        let soham = new Student();
        soham.welcome();
        // we can create number of object using same class
